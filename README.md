# Shopping App Template

#### Simple AngularJS app that uses data from an API to display Items for Sale.

##### User selects a item category (t-shirts/hats/etc), then can view specific items within that category with price and color. Then finally, they can access each individual item in the category within its personal view.  

Created for a Coding Test. Uses simple CSS styling and Angular JS to create a efficient and simple app that can be implemented quickly. 

Feel free to build on top of this model or use it as a template/starting ground for your own application.
